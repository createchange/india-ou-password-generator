This script utilizes a Powershell script to grab users in the India OU. New credentials are randomly generated for the user, and passed into a csv which is password protected by 7zip. This is then emailed out to the manager of this unit.

Created as these users are not on domained computers, and passwords expire on a recurring basis. Automated away 30+ minutes of manually resetting passwords every month.
